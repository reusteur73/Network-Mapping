# Local Network IP Scanner / Mapping

This Python script scans a local network and identifies the IP addresses of devices that are currently alive. It uses the ping command to test each IP address in the range 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254.

## Usage

To run the script, simply execute the following command in your terminal:

`python network_scanner.py`

The script will scan the network. Once the scan is complete, it will print a list of the alive IP addresses and the size of the network.
